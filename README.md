# CPSC 349-01 Project 1: Quiz
Build an interactive quiz web application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Do NOT 
use React, as that will be your final project technology stack. The quiz web application must 
have multiple-choice questions (minimum 10 questions). Give a catchy name to your quiz 
web application.
